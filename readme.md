# Why this doc
Everytime when I change my job, I will need to spend many hours to set up my programming environment associated with ternminal, vim etc. In this doc I will doc the procedures that I did for future reference.

# Step 1 Terminal
I use Iterm2 as terminal application instead of using the default one that Mac provided. You can easily create multiple panes on a single window and easily navigate each one with short cut.

go here, download and install iterm2 https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html

After that, set up the shortcuts by going to 

Iterm2 -> preference -> keys 
In the key bindings -. "+", you can add windows + alt + arrow as short cut to switch among panes. 

In most cases, by default you can use windows key + arrow to navigate between tabs
